        <p>4% said they enjoy finding spiritual enrichment through reading and expanding their worldview. ... 3% said they like being mentally challenged by books. 2% cited the physical properties of books – their feel and smell – as a primary pleasure..Reading has been shown to put our brains into a pleasurable trance-like state, similar to meditation, and it brings the same health benefits of deep relaxation and inner calm. Regular readers sleep better, have lower stress levels.Reading develops our brains and gives us the ability to understand life in a much better fashion.<br><br> When you read a lot, you learn new words all the time. ... Not sure how many readers will agree but I firmly believe books can go more in-depth than a movie can.I love my books. ... Books hold a great charm for me. Some of my friends too have started enjoying reading books as much as I do. Most of my relatives and friends know that the best birthday gift that they can give me is books and with their generosity I have over a hundred books in my personal library now.</p>
